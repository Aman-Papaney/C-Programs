# C-Programs

The following repository is created to document and learn C programming.

Before performing any operations we have to create a structure of linked
list using structures which are provided in C to create custom datatypes.

To create a structure we can write the following code-

struct structure_name \
    { \
        datatype var1; \
        datatype var2; \
        and so on \
    };

SINGLE LINKED LIST

In Single linked list, we first initialise a node containing the
information and address of next node .

1.  The first program is of single linked list in which there are few
    different we can perform like - \
    a.) Printing the linked list . \
    b.) Insertiona at start of linked list .\
    c.) Insertion at end of linked list . \
    d.) Deletion at start of linked list . \
    e.) deletion ar end of linked list . \
    f.) Get number of elements in linked list .
